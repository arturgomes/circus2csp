Circus Parser

Works fine on Ubuntu 15.04 and Mac OSX 10.11

To compile, run:

$ make circus

It will create an executable "circus"

$./circus

In order to parse a file, you need to first
load the file

CircusParser> load ex4.tex

Then to save it, 

CircusParse> show

It will save the file into the file "spec.txt",
and you can see it when you quit the repl.

If you want to load a second file without
quitting the repl, you need to type "reset"

CircusParser> reset

And then load the file as you wish.
