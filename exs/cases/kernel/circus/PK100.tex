\section{PK-100} % ======================================================================

The partitioning kernel shall allow an authorised partition
to start any partition (STOPPED mode to ACTIVE mode)
with a WARM or COLD starting type.

Rationale: This capability is required by an authorized partition such as the
system partition to control the re-start of other partitions.

Note: The PK provides a service to start a partition in COLD or WARM starting
type. This service is only accessible to an authorized partition.

In practice it is expected that only one authorized partition (the system
partition) will be allowed to stop and re-start another partition. When the
binary code and the data of the partition are reinitialised at application
level (re-copy of code and data from its non volatile memory) a COLD restart
should be applied as all the memory context of the considered partition is
then lost.
