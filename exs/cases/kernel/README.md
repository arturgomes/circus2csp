# README #

This repo contains Process-algebraic models intended to explore formal modelling and verification
of partitioning kernels. Originally these models where hand-written in machine-readable CSP (CSPm),
but now we are exploring writing models using Circus, and then automatically translating these to CSPm.


### Tools ###

* Running the models requires [FDR4](https://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/projects/fdr/)

### Contributors ###

* Andrew Butterfield - top level oversight and model reworking from July 2016 onwards
* Kevin Hennessy - developed original CSP models
* Artur O. Gomes - developed Circus to CSPm translator
