# README #

This repo contains Process-algebraic models intended to explore formal modelling and verification
of partitioning kernels. Originally these models where hand-written in machine-readable CSP (CSPm),
but now we are exploring writing models using Circus, and then automatically translating these to CSPm.

## Folders ##

* `oCSPm`  original hand-crafted CSPm model used for DASIA 2017 work.
* `circus` new Circus versions of the models
* `gCSPm`  CSPm models generated by Circus
* `doc` General documents


### Tools ###

* Running the models requires [FDR4](https://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/projects/fdr/)
* Translating from Circus requires c2c (this repo.) [github](https://bitbucket.org/circusmodelcheck/jazaextended.git)

### Contributors ###

* Andrew Butterfield - top level oversight and model reworking from July 2016 onwards
* Kevin Hennessy - developed original CSP models
* Artur O. Gomes - developed Circus to CSPm translator
