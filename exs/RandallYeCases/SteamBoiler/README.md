This is a case study of the steam boiler solution in Circus, and it is originally from a technical report written by Jim Woodcock's : "A Circus Steam Boiler using the unifying theory of Z and CSP", and finally corrected and improved by introducing the model checking into Circus by linking it to CSP || B.

- The Circus specification is under *Circus* folder

- The linked program in CSP || Z is under *CSP_Z* folder

- *Reports* folder
    + Jim Woodcock's original report
