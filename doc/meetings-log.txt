What's left:

Implement two refinement laws for Processes and not Actions
- Embed it into the Omega Process or make an entinre tool for it?

Mechanism to apply the refinement laws into constructs such as
[] i @ c_i -> A(i)




Questions:

How to fix the use of datatypes in the value/tag constructs?

How to eliminate the use of parametrised actions within the main action, as any local variable is removed in the refinement process?
